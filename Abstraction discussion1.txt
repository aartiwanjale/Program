Why Java does not support multiple inheritance or what is Diamond problem in Java? 


class Abc{
	void eat(){
		System.out.println("Indians eat using their hands");
	}
}

class Xyz extends Abc{
	void eat(){
		System.out.println("Western people don't use their hands for eating.");
	}

}


class MultipleInheritanceTest extends Abc{


	psvm(){
	
		MultipleInheritanceTest test = new MultipleInheritanceTest();
		test.display();
	}


}






What are OOPS concepts?
1) Inheritance
2) Abstraction
3) Encapsulation
4) Polymorphism

Q) What is abstraction in Java and how do we achieve it?
Ans: Abstraction is process of hiding implementation details and showing only what is required.
We achieve abstraction in java using abstract class and interface.


two types : 1) Abstract  2) non abstract or concrete classes

Abstract class rules:

1) Its not mandatory to have abstract method in abstract class.
2) If we define any abstract method in a class, then that class must be abstract class.
3) We can not create an object of abstract class.
4) If one abstract class extends another abstact class.
then its not manadatory for that child class to provide method implementations of abstract methods of super class.
5) If concrete/non abstract class extends  abstract class.
then its  manadatory for that child class to provide method implementations of abstract methods of super class.


Assignment:
1) What is Data type in Java and what are different types of Data types in Java?
2) Write a program(create methods in class) which takes those data types as parameters.














1) Inheritance -> 
Q) What is Inheritance in Java?
Ans. Using Inheritance we can access parent class properties/methods.

Q) What is signifance of Inhertiance?
Ans. Code reusability.

Q) How do we achieve inheritance in Java?
Ans. By using extends keyword.

Assignment:
What are different types of Inheritance and write program for each.



Great Grand Father -> Grand Father -> Father         -> Child  -> Grand child
2 acre             -> 2 acre(4)   -> 8 acre(12 acre) -> 0 acre -> 12 acre + 20 acre
