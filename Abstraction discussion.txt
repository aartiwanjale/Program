OOPS Concepts:
1) Abstraction
2) Encapsulation
3) Inheritance
4) Polymorphism


1) Abstract

What is Abstraction  -> Showing what is essential and hidding details.

What are the ways to achieve Abstraction in Java?
Why we create an Abstract class?
-> By Using Abstract class we can achieve Abstraction in Java.
-> Interface is nothing but 100% Abstract class.


Abstract/Interface we use them at class Level.


How do we implement Abstraction in Java?



abstract void test();   Abstract method does not contain method body.

void test() {
 //Business Logic
}       Non Abstract method contain method body.

We can not create Object of Abstract class.
But Abstract class can have Constructor.

Why we use Constructor -> For Object creation.

If we can't create Object of Abstract class then why we have Constructor?
Class have different properties/attributes, when we Con gets called these properties/attributes gets default value assigned to them.



So whenever the first non abstract/Concrete class Extends abstract class, it needs to provide implementation of Abstract methods.

Difference between private and Abstract method?

Abstract means you have to provide implementation.
